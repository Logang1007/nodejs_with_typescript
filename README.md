# nodejs_with_typescript
This nodejs template allows you code in typescript and it includes a mssql implementation wrapper with a api wrapper.

1. Run the Create_DB.sql file in Sql Management studio
2. To run the project in dev, run the buildandrun_dev.bat
3. Modify the .env.appsettings file(in the dist folder) to point to your sql server

This template will help you learn how to use typescript in a nodejs project. I have included a fully functioning api that writes to a SQL database,
which will teach you how to make SQL calls in nodejs.

Thanks
